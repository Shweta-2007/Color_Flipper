# Color_Flipper

The Color Flipper project is a simple web application that allows users to change the background color of a webpage by clicking a button. It's a fun and interactive way to experiment with different color combinations. When the "CLICK ME" button is pressed, the background color of the page changes to a randomly selected color from a predefined array of colors. The name of the color is displayed in text form as well as in the form of a color code.

Random Color Generation: The application randomly selects a color from a predefined array of colors.

The Hex Color Flipper project is an extension of the Color Flipper, providing users with random hex color codes as well as colorful backgrounds. When the "CLICK ME" button is pressed, a random hex color code is generated, and the page's background color is updated accordingly. The hex color code is displayed alongside the color.

Hex Color Generation: The project generates random hex color codes by combining characters and numbers.
